"""
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. 
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
"""

# my approach: if we see a 1, we can perform a DFS starting from that cell. then, mark all 1's in the group as a 0
# as the for loop progresses, it will find the next 1's and keep incrementing the count
